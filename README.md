A simple Express + TypeScript server setup.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

in respective projects

Currently very basic, plans to add:
-An environment file to adjust ports etc
-Dockerise
-Cut out bloat on frontend and make more basic/familiarise
-connect frontend + backend so that we have some basic communication going on
